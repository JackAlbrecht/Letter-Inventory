# Letter-Inventory
Letter Inventory is a program to demonstrate classes and arrays. This allows us to use the ASCII rankings of the alphabet to rearrange words to be in a-z format.

This program uses 2 classes:
- LetterInventory: This holds all the necessary methods to rearrange the letters, put two words together, and even subtract two words, as well as a constructor which allows us to pass through our own words.
- LetterInventoryMain: This is the main method, I put this outside of the LetterInventory class to demonstrate that we are pulling the LetterInventory constructor method to create our objects inventory 1 and inventory 2.

In this way we are able to rearrange letters based on the ASCII number away from 'a' of each letter, to rearrange all words to a-z format.
